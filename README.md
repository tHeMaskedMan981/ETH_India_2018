## Our Aim 
We want to add to the different kinds of financial instruments that one can use on the blockchain. 
What we worked on through this hackathon was to create a land registry on the blockchain. 
This will always involve some central (Governmental) authority to verify the land, which we would require by needing people upload some proof of ownership (land reistry certificate) to IPFS. 

We would store its hash in the blockchain. We would generate ERC20 tokens for the land. 
These tokens can be used as collateral with Lendroid, to get Dai and to empower people to take loans against their land.
